# üìù Contract Negotiation Tool by Silver.dev

## Introduction

Every agency needs to negotiate with a prospective client. Discussing mathematical formulas with language is awkward, and the email back and forth is lengthy and uncomfortable.

We want to build a tool that makes it easier and more formal to communicate a negotiation, one in which each party's interests are best represented for maximum utility.

## Objectives

- Create a tool that models and expresses contract value more accurately than pure intuition
- Create a tool that improves negotiations between clients and agencies

## Goals

- Create a single-page tool that allows any anonymous user to gauge contract value
- [Stretch] Automatize tool ‚Üí actual contract creation

### Design

![Mock-up](./mockup.png)

- There are multiple features to consider for the model:
  - Financials (deferred payment, pure contingency/retainer, financing, credit card processing)
  - Discounts for volume, promotions
  - Exclusivity discounts
- Example prompt: <https://chatgpt.com/share/67bdc5f6-4ce8-800e-aa11-5641c80418ac>

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
